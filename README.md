## Flappy Bird Clone written in JavaScript

The whole game from the images to the pipes to the cat has been re-written in JavaScript using the p5 Library. 

Further work required to add AI to the game to try and learn how to play. 

## Two Versions are upcoming:

1. Simple Genetic Algorithm
2. NEAT Algorithm

## Current Architecture

With the inclusion of global leaderboards and login, I integrated the p5.js library with a backend API written in Python Flask
